        <p class="gray mbottom30">Networking is everywhere; you’ll find its core principles in Application Development and Systems Architecture. The web is nothing more then a wide-net of Routers, Servers and Cables. Understanding the principles of Protocols, Routing, DNS and Network topology are critical to understanding how Hosting Environments, Browsers, Domains and even API’s work fundamentally. I’ve relied upon my cisco basics on a daily basis through out much of my career as a developer. </p>
