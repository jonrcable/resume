        <p class="gray mbottom30">DeVry allowed me to polish off my work experience by adding a more diverse perspective in business. I really enjoyed my time at DeVry, their ability to offer night/weekend classes with real in classroom instruction/discussion all while I worked full time meet my needs. Some of my favorite projects at DeVry included breaking down real life case studies. We covered a lot of very controversial technical topics beyond programing, system and architecture. Business cases like General Motors moving operations to Russia, the global reality of Monsanto’s GMO technologies on agriculture and Walmart’s global impact on distribution were some of the most impactful.</p>
