        <p class="gray mbottom30">Early in my technical career the web was not what it is today, MySpace had not even been born yet. Fueled by onsite work experience and personal projects I was literally making the rules up as I went along. Most colleges barely covered HTML and systems; classes in web programming were just evolving. Since I had been working with Hardware/Software since the early MSDOS days I choose to concentrate on learning networking specifically working in controlled labs on  Microsoft and Cisco Enterprise implementations. This core background in networking/information systems has proven to be an invaluable foundation for my technical career. </p>
